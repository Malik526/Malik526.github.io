# Reflection Essay

## 1. Discuss one challenge you overcame during your academic development. What was the challenge, was it technical, nontechnical, or both, and how did you overcome it?

During my acadmeic development there were many challenges I had to overcome. Coming from a familly that are immigrants from Guyana and being a first generation bron American I did not have much guidance navigating college and the American educational system. From the time I was a senior in High School it was on me to get myself in college and handle financilal andd academic nuances that came with it. I had to learn many of valuabe lessons I know now through trial and error which ofcourse came with its cost as well. I remember working dillegintly my freshman year for GPA well above a 3.0 just so I can qualify for my scholarships just to find out I would not qualify for these scholarships after achieving the GPA I wanted because my mom has residency in New York so. This was my first major disappointment in college. The following year I dealt with one of my hardest semesters in school while also feeling homesick about being so far away from my family in NYC while attending Charleston Southern University in South Carolina. This ledd to me considering transfering to a school in NYC and eventually taking a one year break from being a student. Throughout the rest of college I've dealt with many acaddemic, personal, emotional, and familly related challenges.
